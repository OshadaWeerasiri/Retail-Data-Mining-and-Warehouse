## Retail Data Mining and Warehouse

This project implements a comprehensive retail data warehouse solution using Snowflake and Python. Starting with a detailed understanding and cleaning of the provided sales-data.csv,
a suitable star schema was designed and implemented in Snowflake for efficient analytics. ETL processes were performed to load and transform the data.
Advanced data mining techniques were applied to generate actionable business insights, including shipment status prediction, sales forecasting, order profitability analysis,
customer segmentation, and geographic performance visualization. The project also includes evaluation metrics and visualizations to support findings.
Bonus features include Power BI integration and optional real-time data streaming with Snowflake Streams and Tasks.
